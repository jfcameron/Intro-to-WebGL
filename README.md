## Description
Materials for an introductory talk I did on WebGL.
Contains a Writeup and a code sample.

The writeup introduces key OpenGL concepts and points out notable projects already making use of HTML5/WebGL technology.
The sample shows:

- how to initalize a WebGL 1.0 context
- how to create and use your own shader programs
- how to asynchronously load textures over the network
- how to create and use vertex data
- how to use all the above to draw and spin a quad

These materials can be viewed online here: [live demo](http://jfcameron.github.io/Articles/WebGL101Seminar/content.html)
